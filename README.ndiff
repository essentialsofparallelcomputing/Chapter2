# The Ndiff package can be installed manually by downloading from

Some of the package managers have an ndiff, but make sure it is the
numerical differencing package. There is another package with the same
name that is included in some package managers.

Numdiff is an alternative program that performs the same function. It
is at https://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/
